# 🚀 Fusion System Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Lie Detector project now has a **Fusion System** that combines predictions from **Text** and **Voice** models using a weighted ensemble approach. This provides more accurate results than individual models.

---

## 📁 What Was Created

### Backend Files

1. **`backend/Fusion/app.py`** - Main fusion backend with weighted ensemble algorithm
2. **`backend/Fusion/requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
3. **`backend/Fusion/README.md`** - Technical documentation
4. **`backend/start_all_backends.bat`** - Convenient script to start all 3 backends at once

### Frontend Files

Updated **`frontend/src/pages/FusionDashboard.tsx`** with:
- Text input field
- Audio file upload
- API integration with fusion backend
- Beautiful results visualization showing:
  - Final prediction (Truthful/Deceptive)
  - Confidence scores
  - Individual model breakdowns
  - Weight distribution charts
  - Model comparison charts

---

## 🏃 How to Run

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)

**Double-click** `backend/start_all_backends.bat` to start all three backends automatically:
- Text Backend → Port 8000
- Voice Backend → Port 8001  
- Fusion Backend → Port 8002

### Option 2: Manual Start

Open 3 separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Text Backend:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\91829\OneDrive\Desktop\Lie Detector (MAIN)\backend\Text"
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Voice Backend:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\91829\OneDrive\Desktop\Lie Detector (MAIN)\backend\Voice"
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Terminal 3 - Fusion Backend:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\91829\OneDrive\Desktop\Lie Detector (MAIN)\backend\Fusion"
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8002
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fusion System

1. **Start all backends** (use the batch file or manual method)

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\91829\OneDrive\Desktop\Lie Detector (MAIN)\frontend"
   npm start
   ```

3. **Navigate to Fusion Dashboard** in your app

4. **Test the fusion:**
   - Enter some text in the text input (e.g., "I was at home all night")
   - Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, etc.)
   - Click "Run Fusion Analysis"
   - View the combined results!

## 🎯 How the Fusion Algorithm Works

### Weighted Ensemble Method

**Current Weights:**
- Text Model: 50%
- Voice Model: 50%

*(When face recognition is added, it will be: Text 40%, Voice 40%, Face 20%)*

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Individual Predictions:**
   - Text model analyzes the written statement
   - Voice model analyzes audio patterns

2. **Normalization:**
   - Converts different label formats ("Lie"/"Truth" vs "Deceptive"/"Truthful")
   - Normalizes confidence scores to 0-1 range

3. **Weighted Calculation:**
   ```
   Final Score = (Text Score × 0.5) + (Voice Score × 0.5)
   ```

4. **Decision:**
   - If Final Score > 0.5 → "Deceptive"
   - If Final Score ≤ 0.5 → "Truthful"

5. **Reasoning:**
   - Generates explanation based on model agreement and confidence levels

## 📊 Frontend Features

The Fusion Dashboard displays:

### 1. Input Section
- Text input area with character count
- Audio file upload with drag-and-drop style UI

### 2. Final Result Card
- Large verdict display (Truthful/Deceptive)
- Animated confidence progress bar
- AI-generated reasoning
- Weighted score and model count

### 3. Individual Model Cards
- Each model shows:
  - Prediction result
  - Confidence percentage
  - Weight in final decision
  - Contribution to final score

### 4. Visualization Charts
- **Bar Chart:** Side-by-side confidence comparison
- **Pie Chart:** Model weight distribution

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting Model Weights

Edit `backend/Fusion/app.py`, line 48:

```python
weights = {"text": 0.50, "voice": 0.50, "face": 0.0}
```

Change the values (must sum to 1.0) based on your model performance testing.

### Changing Decision Threshold

Edit `backend/Fusion/app.py`, line 74:

```python
final_prediction = "Deceptive" if final_score > 0.5 else "Truthful"
```

Adjust `0.5` to make the system more/less sensitive.

---

## 🚧 Adding Face Recognition (Future)

When face recognition is ready:

1. **Update the fusion algorithm:**
   ```python
   weights = {"text": 0.40, "voice": 0.40, "face": 0.20}
   ```

2. **Add face API call** in `predict_fusion()` function

3. **Update frontend** to include video/image upload

4. The algorithm is already prepared to handle 3 models!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting

**Error:** Module not found
- **Solution:** Install dependencies
  ```bash
  cd backend/Fusion
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### API Connection Failed

**Error:** "Failed to perform fusion analysis"
- **Check:** All 3 backends are running on correct ports
- **Test:** Visit http://127.0.0.1:8002/health to check fusion backend

### Port Already in Use

**Error:** Port 8000/8001/8002 is already in use
- **Solution:** Kill the process or change the port in the command

### Voice Model Returns Different Format

The fusion backend automatically handles:
- "Lie" → "Deceptive"
- "Truth" → "Truthful"
- Confidence % (0-100) → Decimal (0-1)

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Test Individual Models First:**
   - Verify text analysis works alone
   - Verify voice analysis works alone
   - Then test fusion

2. **Optimize Weights:**
   - Use a validation dataset
   - Test different weight combinations
   - Choose the combination with best accuracy

3. **Monitor Results:**
   - Keep track of when models agree vs. disagree
   - Identify patterns in failures
   - Adjust weights accordingly

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] All 3 backends running without errors
- [ ] Frontend loads without console errors
- [ ] Can input text and upload audio
- [ ] Fusion analysis returns results
- [ ] Results display correctly with charts
- [ ] Individual model breakdowns show correct data

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Collect test data** with both text and audio
2. **Evaluate fusion accuracy** compared to individual models
3. **Fine-tune weights** based on performance
4. **Prepare for face recognition integration**
5. **Deploy to production** when ready

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check terminal/console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure model files exist in correct locations
4. Test each backend individually before fusion
